📄 PDF Converter &amp; Document Management Tool (Offline Desktop App)
This project is a Python-based desktop application that provides essential PDF and document management functionalities such as conversion, splitting, merging, and page manipulation — all performed locally on the user’s machine.The primary objective of this tool is to avoid uploading sensitive documents to online or third-party platforms, ensuring data privacy, confidentiality, and full control over files.
This project was developed using AI-assisted guidance along with a foundational understanding of Python. AI tools were used to accelerate learning, debugging, and library integration while building a functional, offline desktop application.

**❓ Why This Project Exists**
Most free PDF tools require users to upload documents online, which poses privacy and security risks—especially for resumes, internal reports, HR documents, and administrative files.
This tool solves that problem by:
Running completely offline
Performing all processing locally
Eliminating third-party data exposure

**Key Highlights**
🖥️ Desktop-based (Tkinter GUI)
🔐 Privacy-first, offline processing
📄 PDF → Word / Excel conversion
✂️ Split, merge, and remove PDF pages
📊 Table extraction using Pandas
⏳ Progress bars for long operations
🤖 AI-assisted development with hands-on learning

**🛠 Tech Stack Explained**
Python 3.9+ – The programming language used to create the tool; it controls all the actions the tool can perform.
Tkinter (GUI) – Makes the tool easy to use with buttons and windows instead of typing commands.
PyPDF2 – Helps the tool split, merge, and remove pages in PDF files.
pdf2docx – Converts PDF files into Word documents so you can edit them easily.
pdfplumber – Reads tables inside PDFs so the data can be exported to Excel.
pandas – Organizes data from PDFs or Word documents into Excel spreadsheets.
python-docx – Reads and writes Word documents for conversion or extraction.
openpyxl – Lets the tool save data in Excel (.xlsx) files.
